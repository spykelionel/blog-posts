# HacktoberFest 2022 

If you came here for Hacktoberfest ü¶áÔ∏è:

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some tasks in this project.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

 HacktoberFest is digitalocean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout october. Much of modern tech infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of digitalocean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. HacktoberFest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
